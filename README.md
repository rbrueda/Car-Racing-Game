# car-racing-game

This interactive two-dimensional game is built using the programming language Python, more specficially, using the library Pygame. The game's objective is to race a computer-controlled car while the user uses the keyboard controls to move their car. The purpose of this project was for an independent study unit for my Grade 12 French class, in which we were tasked to learn/create something by ourselves. Due to my interest in learning more about Python, I followed Tech With Tim's series in "Car Racing Game using pygame" to help me develop this game. \
The main features this game are: 
1. Multiple masks and markers(path coordinates) to track where the car track is located such that the cars drive past the track. 
2. Contains a reset function where when one of the cars pass the finish line, level wil either restart or increase level by one.
3. Function to terminate game when user beats all Levels.
4. To track the velocity of the user car during the race and displays it in the screen.
5.  To track the time it takes for the race to finish which is displayed in the screen.
6. Computer generated car created using trignometric relations to calculate angles the car moves with respect to the track.
7. Users have ability to move car by using keyboard key "w" to move forward, "s" to move backwards, "a" to rotate left, and "d" to rotate right.
8. Computer car will increase velocity as levels increase.
